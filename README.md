COUNTDOWN YA BISHES
Project Title
Phish @ The Sphere — Countdown (1990s Internet Edition)
A gloriously janky, single-page countdown website for Phish at the Las Vegas Sphere on May 2, 2026, styled like it was built on GeoCities at 2 a.m. with a screaming modem.

What This Is
	•	A static HTML countdown page
	•	Zero backend, zero frameworks
	•	Designed to be shared as a link with friends attending the show
	•	Intentionally ugly, chaotic, and extremely online
Features include:
	•	Live countdown to showtime (Pacific Time)
	•	Autoplaying MIDI (browser-permitting)
	•	Bouncing Phish logo (DVD screensaver physics)
	•	Visitor counter (localStorage, very honest)
	•	Randomized background colors on each load
	•	Logo speed increases as showtime approaches
	•	<marquee> and blinking text because we fear nothing
